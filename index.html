      <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Sentiment Analysis for Customer Reviews</h2>
      As a part of this project, I developed a machine learning model to analyze customer reviews of a product or service and determine whether the sentiment expressed was positive, negative or neutral. The model was trained on a large dataset of reviews and achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting the sentiment of new reviews. This model could be used to quickly identify areas where a company needs to improve its product or service.

      <h2>Image Captioning using Neural Networks</h2>
      This project involved developing an image captioning system that generates captions for images using a deep neural network. The system was trained on a large dataset of images and their associated captions, and it can now generate captions for new images with a high level of accuracy. The system could be used in a variety of applications, including creating descriptions for social media posts or generating captions for images in news articles.

      <h2>Automated Email Classification</h2>
      In this project, I developed a machine learning model that automatically classifies emails into different categories based on their content. The model was trained on a large dataset of emails and was able to accurately classify emails into categories such as "spam," "urgent," and "newsletter." This system could be integrated into an email client to automatically sort incoming emails and help users manage their inbox more efficiently.

      <h2>Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions</h2>
      As a part of this project, I developed a machine learning model that analyzes credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activity. The model was trained on a dataset of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions and was able to accurately predict whether a given transaction was fraudulent or not. This system could be used by credit card companies to automatically flag suspicious transactions and prevent fraudulent activity.

      <h2>Chatbot for Customer Support</h2>
      This project involved developing a chatbot that can provide customer support for a product or service. The chatbot uses natural language processing to understand customer queries and provide appropriate responses. The chatbot was trained on a large dataset of customer queries and was able to provide accurate responses to new queries with a high level of accuracy. This system could be used to provide 24/7 customer support and reduce the workload on customer service representatives.
